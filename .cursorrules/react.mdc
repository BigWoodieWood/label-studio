# React Best Practices

## Component Structure
- Use functional components over class components
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper prop types with TypeScript
- Split large components into smaller, focused ones

## Hooks
- Follow the Rules of Hooks
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Keep hooks focused and simple
- Avoid useEffect unless absolutely required
- Use appropriate dependency arrays in useEffect
- Implement cleanup in useEffect when needed
- Avoid nested hooks

## State Management
- Use useState for local component state
- Use Jotai atoms and not the Context API for shared state
- Implement atomWithReducer for complex state logic
- Implement atomWithQuery for any API requests for data
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Avoid prop drilling through proper state management
- Only use Jotai as the single source of truth of global state management

## Performance
- Implement proper memoization (useMemo, useCallback)
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Implement proper lazy loading
- Use proper key props in lists
- Profile and optimize render performance

## Forms
- Use controlled components for form inputs
- Implement proper form validation
- Handle form submission states properly
- Show appropriate loading and error states
- Use form libraries for complex forms
- Implement proper accessibility for forms

## Error Handling
- Implement Error Boundaries
- Handle async errors properly
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Implement proper fallback UI
- Log errors appropriately
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## Testing
- Write unit tests for components
- Implement integration tests for complex flows
- Use React Testing Library
- Test user interactions
- Test error scenarios
- Implement proper mock data

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers
- Handle focus management
- Provide proper alt text for images

## Code Organization
- Use proper file naming conventions which is kebab-case ie. ListItem -> `list-item.tsx`
- Prefer one component per folder, but group related components together when necessary, but ensure there is only one component per file.
- Component folders should have a SCSS `.module.scss` with the name of the component kebab-case ie. ListItem -> `list-item.module.scss`
- Implement proper directory structure
- UI components should live within `web/libs/ui`
- Application components that are shared across applications such as certain page-level blocks should live within `web/libs/app-common`
- No cyclic imports
- Code in `web/apps` can only import code from `web/libs` and `web/libs` cannot import from `web/apps`
- Keep atoms in a global atoms folder with the name of the file matching the entity or intent of state
- Use proper imports/exports
- Document complex component logic
- Add all components to Storybook by co-locating the story file next to the component file ie. `list-item.stories.tsx`
- Use the `@humansignal/ui` package for UI components
- Use the `@humansignal/icons` package for icons
- Use the `@humansignal/core` package for core utilities/functions
- Use the `@humansignal/app-common` package for application components
